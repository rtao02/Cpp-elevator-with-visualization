# Implement an Elevator with Multi-thread                                                        

This project concerns using multi-thread logic to schedule events of all elevators in one building. 

## Getting Started

Install Microsoft Visual Studio 2019

## Running the tests

Test with visualization:
Copy code in "TermProject_Tao_rtao02_withvisualization.txt" to one C++ project
Input carts number -> Input levels -> Input requests number

Test without visualization:(this test will should all state in statement which easier to check how many requests have been processed)
Copy code in "TermProject_Tao_rtao02_withoutvisualization.txt" to one C++ project
Input carts number -> Input levels -> Input requests number
